# Case Study: Black Sabbath – “Black Sabbath” (1970)

## Overview

The eponymous opening track of Black Sabbath’s debut album is widely regarded as the birth of heavy metal and a quintessential example of using the Circle of Fifths to evoke dread. The song’s iconic riff, built around a tritone (the “devil’s interval”), and its slow, circular harmonic motion create a sense of impending doom that defined the genre’s aesthetic.

## Harmonic Analysis

### The Tritone Riff
The main riff (E–G–C–D–E♭) outlines a diminished fifth between G and D♭ (the latter spelled as C♯ in the recording but functionally equivalent). This tritone is presented not as a passing dissonance but as a static, repeating motif. The riff oscillates between E and the tritone‑related G–D♭ axis, effectively “stalling” the Circle of Fifths at its most dissonant point.

**Chordal Reduction**: The riff implies a harmonic progression that can be interpreted as:
- i (E minor) → ♭VI (C major) → ♭VII (D major) → ♭V (E♭/G♭ major)

The move from D major (♭VII) to E♭ major (♭V) is a chromatic upward shift of a semitone, a lateral displacement that bypasses the circle’s fifth‑wise logic. The ♭V chord (E♭) is a tritone away from the tonic E, reinforcing the diabolus in musica.

### Circular, Yet Broken, Progressions
After the verse, the song shifts to a blues‑based section in C# minor (the relative major of E minor). The chord sequence here follows a rough circle‑of‑fifths pattern (C♯m–F♯–B–E–A–D–G–C) but is distorted by heavy distortion, dropped tuning, and the persistent tritone coloration. The circle is present as a structural skeleton, yet its effect is one of weight and oppression rather than graceful modulation.

### The “Doom” Cadence
The song’s final cadence returns to the opening tritone riff, but now the tempo drags and the guitars are drenched in feedback. This creates a circular, never‑ending feeling—as if the music is trapped in a loop of its own dissonance. The Circle of Fifths is not a path to resolution but a closed circuit of dread.

## Relationship to the Circle of Fifths

1. **Tritone as Axis**: The riff’s tritone (G–D♭) sits exactly six fifths apart on the circle (G → D → A → E → B → F♯ → D♭). This diametric opposition is exploited as a harmonic “pole” that repels the tonic, creating perpetual tension.

2. **Chromatic Side‑Stepping**: The ♭VII–♭V motion (D to E♭) is a chromatic slide that ignores the circle’s fifth‑based logic. It mimics the “side‑step” of a tritone substitution but applied to power chords, producing a visceral, grinding effect.

3. **Blues‑Inflected Circle**: The mid‑section’s circle‑of‑fifths sequence is filtered through a blues idiom, flattening some of the diatonic thirds and adding “blue” notes. This hybridisation merges the rational geometry of the circle with the raw, expressive dissonance of the blues, amplifying the sense of unease.

## Affective Impact

- **Temporal Distortion**: The slow tempo (approx. 78 bpm) and repetitive riff give the impression of time stretching and collapsing, a musical analogue to the feeling of being trapped.
- **Timbral Dread**: Tony Iommi’s heavily distorted guitar tone and Geezer Butler’s rumbling bass fill the harmonic space with noise, blurring the edges of the circle and turning it into a murky, oppressive atmosphere.
- **Lyrical Synergy**: Ozzy Osbourne’s lyrics (“What is this that stands before me? / Figure in black which points at me”) describe a supernatural encounter. The tritone‑based harmony sonically paints the “figure in black,” making the circle a symbol of the unknown and the terrifying.

## Conclusion

“Black Sabbath” demonstrates how the Circle of Fifths can be bent into a tool of horror. By foregrounding the tritone, disrupting the circle’s expected motion with chromatic slips, and embedding the whole structure in a slow, heavy texture, the song transforms theoretical geometry into a visceral experience of doom. It is a foundational case of how rock music can harness the “dark side” of the circle to create a new affective palette.
