# Chromatic Doom: A Digital Repository on the Dissonant Circle of Fifths

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a curated academic resource investigating the "darker" applications of the Circle of Fifths in music theory, history, and composition. The project explores how the geometric and theoretical structure of the Circle is used to evoke feelings of tension, fear, and dread, both in its historical symbolism and in its practical application within specific musical works.

## Repository Structure

- `theoretical_foundation.md` – Music‑theory foundations of dissonant movements on the Circle of Fifths (tritone substitutions, diminished sevenths, parallel fifths, etc.).
- `historical_symbolism.md` – Historical and occult/symbolic interpretations of the Circle of Fifths and its intervals.
- `case_studies/` – Detailed analyses of individual compositions that employ the Circle of Fifths to create unease or terror.
- `README.md` – This file.

## Research Aims

1. **Theoretical Analysis**: To examine the structural properties of the Circle of Fifths that lend themselves to dissonant, unsettling harmonic progressions.
2. **Historical Context**: To trace the symbolic and occult associations of the Circle and its intervals (e.g., the tritone as *diabolus in musica*) from medieval treatises to modern esoteric thought.
3. **Applied Musicology**: To demonstrate through concrete case studies how composers have harnessed these properties to produce specific emotional effects.

## Usage

This repository is intended for musicologists, theorists, composers, and anyone interested in the intersection of music theory, geometry, and affect. The Markdown files can be read directly on GitHub or cloned for local study.
