# Theoretical Foundations of Dissonant Movements on the Circle of Fifths

## Introduction

The Circle of Fifths is conventionally presented as a closed, symmetrical diagram that organizes the twelve pitch classes according to their key signatures. Moving clockwise ascends by perfect fifths (or descends by perfect fourths); moving counter‑clockwise ascends by perfect fourths (descends by perfect fifths). This geometric regularity has made the circle a staple of tonal pedagogy, yet its very symmetry harbours possibilities for subversion. When composers deliberately break the circle’s smooth flow—by inserting tritones, diminished seventh chords, parallel fifths, or other “forbidden” progressions—they can evoke unease, tension, and a sense of harmonic dislocation. This document outlines the principal theoretical mechanisms through which the Circle of Fifths can be made dissonant and affectively charged.

## 1. The Tritone as “Diabolus in Musica”

### 1.1 Geometric Placement
On the Circle of Fifths, the tritone occupies the position exactly halfway around the circle: six steps clockwise (or counter‑clockwise) from any starting pitch. For example, C → F♯/G♭ is a tritone. This diametric opposition mirrors the interval’s acoustical instability; the two pitches are maximally distant within the twelve‑tone universe.

### 1.2 Tritone Substitution
In functional harmony, a dominant seventh chord can be replaced by another dominant seventh chord whose root is a tritone away. Because the third and seventh of the original chord become the seventh and third of the substitute, the essential guide‑tones (leading‑tone and subdominant) are preserved while the bass moves by a tritone. This substitution breaks the expected fifth‑wise motion of the circle, injecting a sudden, jarring lateral shift.

**Example**: In a ii–V–I progression in C major (Dm7 – G7 – C), the G7 can be replaced by D♭7. The bass moves G → D♭ (tritone) instead of G → C (perfect fifth). The result is a harmonic “side‑step” that disrupts the listener’s expectation of circular continuity.

### 1.3 Augmented Sixth Chords
The Italian, French, and German sixth chords all contain a tritone between the bass (typically ♭6) and the raised fourth (♯4). These chords function as pre‑dominant expansions that resolve outward to an octave on the dominant. Their tritonal core creates a strong pull away from the circle’s orderly fifth‑wise motion, introducing a chromatic wedge that feels harmonically “twisted.”

## 2. Diminished Seventh Chords and the Circle

### 2.1 Symmetry and Ambiguity
A diminished seventh chord divides the octave into four equal minor‑third intervals. Because of its extreme symmetry, any note of the chord can be heard as the root, and the same set‑class can belong to four different keys. This ambiguity makes the diminished seventh chord a powerful tool for obscuring tonal centre and for pivoting abruptly between distant regions of the circle.

### 2.2 Common‑Tone Diminished Sevenths
A common‑tone diminished seventh chord shares one pitch with the chord that follows it, while the other three voices move by half‑step. This progression creates a shimmering, unstable effect that momentarily suspends the circle’s directional logic.

**Example**: In C major, a C°7 (C–E♭–G♭–B♭♭) can resolve to C major by holding the C and moving the other three notes inward by semitone. The harmonic path is not along the circle but through chromatic neighbour motion.

## 3. Parallel Fifths and “Forbidden” Progressions

### 3.1 Historical Prohibition
In strict counterpoint, parallel perfect fifths (and octaves) were forbidden because they weaken the independence of voices and cause a hollow, “empty” sound. This prohibition stems from the acoustical fact that perfect intervals reinforce the harmonic series, making individual lines less distinct.

### 3.2 Deliberate Use for Dread
When a composer writes parallel fifths intentionally, the effect is one of archaic, primal force—as if the music is regressing to a pre‑tonal state. In the context of the Circle of Fifths, moving a series of chords all in parallel fifths effectively freezes the circle; instead of voices leading by step or by fifth, they move in lockstep, creating a monolithic, oppressive texture.

**Example**: The opening of Richard Wagner’s “Das Rheingold” (the famous E♭ pedal) is underpinned by parallel fifths that evoke the primal depths of the Rhine. The circle is not “progressed” but hammered into a static, elemental block.

## 4. Chromatic Mediants and Third‑Relations

### 4.1 Breaking the Circle’s Stepwise Flow
The Circle of Fifths moves by perfect fifths (or fourths). Chromatic mediant relations—major or minor thirds between roots, especially when one or both chords are altered—skip across the circle, connecting keys that are not adjacent. For instance, C major to E major (major third up) jumps three steps clockwise on the circle (C → G → D → A → E). Such a leap feels abrupt, “magical,” or disorienting.

### 4.2 The “Double‑Tonic” Complex
In some late‑Romantic and film‑music contexts, two tonal centres a third apart are treated as equally valid, creating a harmonic ambiguity that the circle cannot resolve. This double‑tonic complex (e.g., C major and E major) suspends the listener between two competing gravitational poles.

## 5. Geometric Subversion: The Circle as a “Broken” Spiral

### 5.1 Non‑Closure
A truly closed circle returns to its starting point after twelve fifths. However, equal‑tempered tuning introduces a slight discrepancy (the Pythagorean comma). Composers can exaggerate this discrepancy by writing progressions that seem to follow the circle but actually drift away from the original key, producing a sense of endless, unresolved wandering.

### 5.2 “Backwards” Motion
Reversing the direction of the circle (moving counter‑clockwise by fifths, i.e., by fourths) is itself a common practice. But when combined with chromatic alterations, the reverse motion can feel like a regression or a collapse. For example, a sequence of descending fifths that incorporates tritone substitutions can spiral downward into ever‑darker harmonic regions.

## 6. Conclusion

The Circle of Fifths is not merely a diagram of key relationships; it is a flexible scaffold that can be bent, broken, and subverted to generate harmonic tension. By employing tritone substitutions, diminished seventh chords, parallel fifths, chromatic mediants, and deliberate geometric distortions, composers can transform the circle from a symbol of tonal order into a vehicle for dread, uncertainty, and affective power. These theoretical foundations provide the vocabulary for analysing the case studies that follow.
