# Historical Symbolism and Occult Interpretations of the Circle of Fifths

## Introduction

Beyond its practical role in music theory, the Circle of Fifths has accumulated a rich tapestry of symbolic and occult associations. From medieval treatises that linked musical intervals to cosmological order, to Renaissance esoteric traditions that saw in the circle a map of divine harmony, and onward to modern occultists who treat it as a diagram of magical correspondences, the circle has consistently served as a bridge between sound and symbolism. This document traces those historical threads, with special attention to the “dark” or dissonant aspects that have been ascribed to certain intervals—most notably the tritone, the “devil in music.”

## 1. Medieval and Renaissance Foundations

### 1.1 The Quadrivium and Cosmic Harmony
In the medieval liberal arts, music belonged to the *quadrivium* (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy), all of which were understood as manifestations of divine number. The perfect consonances—unison, octave, fifth, and fourth—were believed to mirror the harmonic proportions of the cosmos (the *musica mundana*). The circle, as a geometric ideal, represented perfection and eternity. The Circle of Fifths, though not yet formalized as a diagram, was implicit in the Pythagorean tuning system, where successive fifths generated the gamut.

### 1.2 The Tritone as *Diabolus in Musica*
The interval of the augmented fourth/diminished fifth (tritone) was considered so harsh and unstable that medieval theorists forbade its use in strict counterpoint. By the early Renaissance, the label *diabolus in musica* (“the devil in music”) had become attached to it. This prohibition was not merely aesthetic; it reflected a theological worldview in which discord symbolized sin and chaos. The tritone’s position halfway around the circle—exactly six fifths from any starting pitch—made it the “opposite” pole, a musical analogue of evil or negation.

### 1.3 Alchemical and Hermetic Correspondences
Renaissance hermeticism, influenced by figures such as Marsilio Ficino and Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, developed elaborate systems of correspondences between planets, metals, colours, and musical intervals. The circle of fifths could be mapped onto the zodiac or the seven planetary spheres, with each key assigned a specific astrological character. The tritone, occupying the “midnight” point of the circle, was often associated with Saturn—the planet of melancholy, limitation, and hidden knowledge.

## 2. Baroque and Enlightenment: The Circle as Rational Order

### 2.1 The Emergence of the Cyclic Diagram
The explicit diagram of the Circle of Fifths appears in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, coinciding with the rise of equal temperament and the consolidation of major–minor tonality. Johann David Heinichen’s *Der General-Bass in der Composition* (1728) popularized the “circle of keys” as a practical tool for modulation. In this rationalist age, the circle symbolized the Enlightenment ideal of a closed, logical system—a musical counterpart to Newton’s clockwork universe.

### 2.2 The Shadow of Irrationality
Even as the circle became a symbol of order, its “dark side” persisted. The Pythagorean comma—the small discrepancy that prevents a chain of twelve pure fifths from closing exactly on the same pitch—was a reminder that perfect harmony is mathematically impossible in a closed system. This inherent imperfection was sometimes interpreted as a crack in the rational edifice, a hint of chaos lurking beneath the surface of tonal logic.

## 3. Romanticism and the Occult Revival

### 3.1 The Circle as a Magical Diagram
The 19th‑century occult revival, spearheaded by figures like Éliphas Lévi and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, appropriated musical symbolism for magical practice. The Circle of Fifths was reconceived as a “wheel of correspondences” linking keys, colours, tarot cards, and astrological signs. Practitioners might “invoke” a particular key through ritual to evoke its associated spiritual force.

### 3.2 The Tritone in Romantic Horror
Romantic composers—especially in opera and programmatic music—exploited the tritone’s diabolical reputation for dramatic effect. Hector Berlioz’s *Symphonie fantastique* (1830) uses tritones to depict the witches’ Sabbath; Charles Gounod’s *Faust* (1859) associates the interval with Mephistopheles. In these works, the circle is not merely a theoretical map but a narrative device: moving to the tritone‑related key signifies a descent into the supernatural or the monstrous.

## 4. Twentieth‑Century Esotericism and Modern Music

### 4.1 Theosophy and Synaesthesia
Theosophical writers such as Annie Besant and C. W. Leadbeater proposed elaborate schemes of “thought‑forms” in which musical intervals produced specific colours and shapes. The Circle of Fifths was sometimes depicted as a coloured mandala, with each key radiating a distinct spiritual vibration. This synaesthetic approach influenced early 20th‑century composers like Alexander Scriabin, who sought to unite sound, colour, and mystical experience.

### 4.2 Aleister Crowley and Thelema
Aleister Crowley, the founder of Thelema, incorporated musical symbolism into his magical system. In *Liber AL vel Legis* (The Book of the Law), the number 11 (the interval of a tritone if counted inclusively) is given special significance. Crowley’s writings suggest that the circle of fifths could be used as a “map of initiation,” with each key representing a stage on the path to enlightenment—or dissolution.

### 4.3 Film Music and the “Uncanny” Circle
In 20th‑century film scoring, the circle’s geometric predictability is often subverted to create unease. Bernard Herrmann’s score for *Psycho* (1960) uses parallel fifths and tritone‑based harmonies to evoke primal terror; John Williams’s *Jaws* (1975) theme is built on a repeating semitone oscillation that implies a tritonal axis. Here the circle is not presented whole but is felt as a broken, lurking presence.

## 5. Contemporary Occult and Popular Culture

### 5.1 Heavy Metal and the “Diabolus”
The heavy‑metal genre, especially in its doom and black‑metal variants, consciously embraces the tritone as a signifier of rebellion, darkness, and occult themes. Bands like Black Sabbath, Slayer, and Dimmu Borgir use tritone riffs and circle‑of‑fifths progressions that are deliberately “off‑kilter” to produce a sense of dread or nihilism. The circle is thus reclaimed as a symbol of transgression.

### 5.2 Digital Esotericism
In today’s internet‑based occult communities, the Circle of Fifths occasionally appears in “chaos magic” sigils or as part of algorithmic composition systems that generate “cursed” harmonies. Software such as Max/MSP or SuperCollider can be programmed to traverse the circle in unnatural ways, producing uncanny, glitch‑like effects that resonate with contemporary anxieties about technology and control.

## 6. Conclusion

The history of the Circle of Fifths is not only a history of music theory but also a history of ideas. From its medieval role as a reflection of cosmic order, through its demonization of the tritone, to its appropriation by occultists and avant‑garde artists, the circle has consistently served as a projective screen for human fears and fascinations. Its “dark” side—the tritone, the comma, the broken spiral—reminds us that even the most rational systems contain the seeds of their own subversion. Understanding these symbolic layers enriches our appreciation of how composers have used the circle to evoke dread, mystery, and the uncanny.
